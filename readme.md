# Multiplayer Monster Game

This is our group submission for the multiplayer Monster Game, featuring a very streamlined multiplayer experience over a local network. It is possible to play over the internet, however the net code has not yet been optimised to allow for very streamlined gameplay.

For some, this is their very first experience working with git and even within a team. As such please expect a lot of bugs and mess ups, instead, view these as a learning experience.
